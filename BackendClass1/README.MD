# Express.js Application with Mongoose

This is a simple Node.js application built using Express.js and Mongoose to interact with MongoDB.

## Server Setup

The server is instantiated using Express.js. It listens on port 3000 by default.

## Dependencies

- Express.js: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- Body-parser: Used to parse `req.body` in Express.js for PUT or POST requests.
- Mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.

## Database Setup

This application connects to MongoDB running on `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/my_database`.

Make sure MongoDB is installed and running before starting the application.
